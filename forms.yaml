      This form starts the template `HelloWorld` on AWX.

      To make this work, you need an AWX installed with the `HelloWorld` project imported.

      In the `settings`-menu on AnsibleForms, add the AWX connection.

    description: This will kick off the HelloWorld template in AWX.  You can have it
      installed on AWX from github.  It does not expect any variables, so that's
      cool because it should always run :)
